He was in old-time iron armor from head to heel, with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it; and he had a shield, and a sword, and a prodigious spear; and his horse had armor on, too, and a steel horn projecting from his forehead, and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.  \"Fair sir, will ye just?\" said this fellow.  \"Will I which?\"\nReformatted:", "target": "Narrator: When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the grass, with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnearly.
